# EncryptionProgramV1

<b>Developer/Author:</b> Dwight Thomas

<b>About:</b> This program was inspired by my curiously into cyber security. I initially wanted to a password cracker, however I had no idea how to do that from scratch as I have no knowledge as to how passwords are interoperated so I wouldn't how to do a brute force or dictionary attack without the timeout features for most password (where you get locked out after a couple of tries) stopping me. So I decided to encryption program that would encrypt text instead. right now the encryption method is quite simple but I do plan upgrading it for version two of this program.

<b>Description:</b> So the program is opened up on a login window, from there when your login the encryption window will open up. Here you have the options to: open encrypted files, save encrypted files, write text and encrypt and decrypt that text, you can also send an email which will carry you to a next window or you can sign out with will carry you back to the login window. When you enter the send email window there you will be required to enter your email credentials (your address and password) then you enter the recipients email and you will also be able to enter a subject and a body for your email as well as attach up to 5 attachments. After you send the email you will be returned to the encryption window where you can continue of you can sign out and exit. (supported emails for senders, meaning emails you can send from, yahoo, Hotmail, outlook, msn, office365, aol and mail.com).

<b>Instructions (for setup):</b>  You will go to the Encryption Program Setup folder and inside download the EncryptionProgramSetup folder. When that is downloaded open enter then open the debug folder and run the encryptionprogramsetup.exe file. Then just follow the installation shield and it will install. After which you will have the program on your desktop and you can run it from there.

<b>Instructions (for use):</b> When you open the program you will meet a login window the credentials are:

<b>UserName: Dwight</b>

<b>Password: Thomas</b>

<b>Things to Note:</b>

1. You can't open a file that was not encrypted by this program or that is not of .txt type.

2. You can't save you text if it is not encrypted it would allow you, you have to encrypt it first.

3.	Supported email: Yahoo, Hotmail, Msn, Outlook, Aol, Office365 and Mail.com. (Unfortunately Gmail is not supported because to use Gmail you would first have to change settings in your Gmail account and I found that to be impractical.
